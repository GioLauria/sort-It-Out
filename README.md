# SortItOut

SortItOut is a small educational project that implements many sorting
algorithms in pure Python and provides simple timing helpers to benchmark
them on custom datasets. Implementations live in the `sort_it_out` package
and are intentionally handwritten (no external sorting libraries are used).

Supported algorithms
--------------------

The project currently provides these sorting algorithms (click an algorithm
to open its documentation page under the `docs/` folder):

- [Bubble Sort](docs/alghorythms/bubble.md)
- [Quick Sort](docs/alghorythms/quick.md)
- [Merge Sort](docs/alghorythms/merge.md)
- [Selection Sort](docs/alghorythms/selection.md)
- [Insertion Sort](docs/alghorythms/insertion.md)
- [Heap Sort](docs/alghorythms/heap.md)
- [Shell Sort](docs/alghorythms/shell.md)
- [Counting Sort](docs/alghorythms/counting.md)
- [Radix Sort](docs/alghorythms/radix.md)
- [Bucket Sort](docs/alghorythms/bucket.md)
- [Comb Sort](docs/alghorythms/comb.md)
- [Cocktail Sort](docs/alghorythms/cocktail.md)
- [Gnome Sort](docs/alghorythms/gnome.md)

Each docs page contains a short explanation, complexity notes and example
usage for the corresponding algorithm.

Getting started
--------------

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the package and developer dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

3. Run the tests:

```powershell
pytest
```

Pre-commit hooks (recommended)
------------------------------

This repository includes a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to run formatters and
linters (Black, isort, flake8). To enable hooks:

```powershell
pip install pre-commit
python -m pre_commit install
python -m pre_commit run --all-files
```

See `docs/pre-commit.md` for platform-specific notes (Windows and Linux).

Quick usage
-----------

Import algorithms and timing helpers directly from the package:

```python
from sort_it_out import bubble_sort, merge_sort, compare_algorithms

data = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]
print(bubble_sort(data))

algos = {
    "bubble": bubble_sort,
    "merge": merge_sort,
}
results = compare_algorithms(algos, data, repeat=5)
print(results)
```

For realistic benchmarks, prepare datasets of different sizes and
distributions (sorted, reverse-sorted, random, many duplicates) and use
`compare_algorithms` which returns average times in seconds.

Command-line usage
------------------

After installing the package (editable mode during development), a `sortItOut`
console command will be available. Basic usage:

```bash
# sort a file using merge sort (default)
sortItOut -i data.txt

# sort a file using quicksort
sortItOut -i data.txt -s quick

# print timing (average over 5 runs)
sortItOut -i data.txt -s quick --time -r 5

# read from stdin and use bubble sort
cat data.txt | sortItOut -s bubble
```

You can also explicitly pass `-` as the input filename to force reading from
stdin, e.g.:

```bash
cat data.txt | sortItOut -i - -s bubble
```

The `--sort` option accepts algorithm names: bubble, quick, merge, selection,
insertion, heap, shell, counting, radix, bucket, comb, cocktail, gnome.

Graphical interface
-------------------

You can run a simple graphical interface that accepts input, algorithm
selection and displays results using the `--gui` flag:

```bash
sortItOut --gui
```

The GUI uses Tkinter (part of the Python standard library) and requires no
additional dependencies.

Default behaviour
-----------------

If `sortItOut` is invoked with no arguments (just `sortItOut`), the program
will open the graphical interface by default. Pass CLI flags (for example
`-i` or `-s`) to use the command-line mode instead.

Programmatic API
-----------------

You can invoke the tool programmatically from other Python code. Import the
package and call `run()` with an argv-like list to execute the CLI logic and
receive the CLI exit code. Example:

```python
import sort_it_out
exit_code = sort_it_out.run(["-s", "bubble", "-i", "data.txt"])
```

Project changes and current status
----------------------------------

Recent updates made to the repository (what changed and where to look):

- **Versioning:** `__version__` is now generated by `setuptools_scm` at
    build/install time and written to `src/sort_it_out/_version.py`. At
    runtime the package prefers that generated value and falls back to the
    latest git tag when the generated file is missing.

- **Packaging metadata:** `pyproject.toml` was updated to enable
    `setuptools_scm` and to include a short project status (Development
    Status: Beta). See `pyproject.toml` for details.

- **Programmatic entrypoint:** The package exposes `run(argv)` from
    `src/sort_it_out/__init__.py` so other Python programs can invoke the
    CLI logic directly without spawning a subprocess.

- **CLI & GUI:** A command-line interface (`sortItOut`) and a simple
    Tkinter GUI are available. The tool opens the GUI by default when called
    with no arguments. See the `Command-line usage` and `Graphical
    interface` sections above and `src/sort_it_out/cli.py` /
    `src/sort_it_out/gui.py` for implementation details.

- **Launcher and executables:** A `launcher.py` file at the repository
    root provides a PyInstaller entry point. The repository includes
    instructions to build a single-file executable (Windows `.exe`) using
    PyInstaller; built artifacts appear under `dist/` locally.

- **CI / Releases:** A GitHub Actions workflow was added to build
    platform artifacts on tag pushes and create a GitHub Release. The
    release job now declares required `permissions` so the release action
    can create releases and attach artifacts reliably.

- **Documentation:** Per-algorithm docs are available under
    `docs/alghorythms/` and contributor docs cover testing, pre-commit and
    building executables.

- **Tooling & quality:** Pre-commit hooks (Black, isort, flake8) and
    a test suite (pytest) are included. Tests and hooks run locally via the
    developer instructions in this README and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

If you'd like, I can also add a short release checklist to the docs that
shows the steps we use to build artifacts, tag releases and publish
packages (PyPI or GitHub Packages). Let me know if you want that.
