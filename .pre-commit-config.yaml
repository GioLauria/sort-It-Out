  # NOTE: pytest hook removed to avoid failing commits when pytest is not
  # available in the system environment. Run tests locally with
  # `python -m pytest -q` or enable the hook when pytest is installed.

# Optional: enable the pytest pre-commit hook in environments where
# pytest should run automatically. Uncomment the block below to enable.
# The hook uses `language: python` and `additional_dependencies` so
# pre-commit will create an isolated venv and install pytest for the
# hook; this avoids depending on a system-wide pytest executable.
