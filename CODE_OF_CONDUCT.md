# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines expected behavior for contributors to the
SortItOut project. The goal is to create a welcoming, respectful, and
collaborative community for everyone.

1. Be respectful and inclusive. Treat others with kindness and assume good
	intent. Value diverse perspectives and experiences.

2. Follow professional and courteous communication. Use constructive
	language in issues, pull requests, and discussions. Avoid personal attacks,
	harassment, or discriminatory language.

3. Do not tolerate harassment. Harassment, threats, hateful speech, or
	repeated abusive behavior are not acceptable and may result in removal
	from the community and being blocked from the project's resources.

4. Be collaborative. When raising concerns, provide clear, actionable
	feedback and allow maintainers time to respond. Offer solutions where
	possible and be open to suggestions.

5. Respect privacy. Do not share private or confidential information about
	others without explicit permission.

Reporting and enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct,
please report it to the project maintainers at: giovanni.lauria@gmail.com. All
reports will be handled with discretion and reviewed by the maintainers. The
maintainers may take actions they deem appropriate, including private
warnings, removal of offensive content, or banning disruptive contributors.

Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces (issue trackers, pull
requests, mailing lists, chat channels, and other official project forums)
and to behavior at project-organized events.

Acknowledgements

This document is a short, practical Code of Conduct for the SortItOut
project. It is intended to be clear and actionable; maintainers may extend
or adapt it as needed.
